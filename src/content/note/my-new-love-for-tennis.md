title: My New Love For Tennis
description: As a youngster, I used to love playing Mario Tennis and some other ATP Tennis Pro game on XBOX that was fun. But recently, I have become hooked on the sport and aim to start playing when I get things on track.

Most passions I've ever developed in my life have started in one of two ways: either by playing a video game or watching something on TV. You could say tennis started on the video game console as I used to play a tennis game we all have played before, Mario Tennis as well as a more obscure tennis game that came with the XBOX. I can't remember what it is called, all I know was it was the default game that came with the original XBOX that we received for Christmas one year from my Uncle Daniel. active

I should add that my love for tennis didn't stem only from playing video games. It came from a more recent endeavor that I love, sports betting. It is sort of random how I came across betting on tennis and it may make me sound like a degenerate gambler, but I am not, so bear with me here.active

One night while sitting in our tent and playing this Fanduel Skills game where you kick field goals in an effort to accumulate more points than your opponent, I ran out of money available in my balance to play a game. You need $0.60 and I failed to win my only opportunity to continue playing and was left with $0.10 cents in my account. It was around 2 AM and I was having trouble sleeping, so I thought, "Why don't I put the ten cents I have on some live events and see if I can make enough money to keep playing?". Wonderful idea actually, except the only sports going on at 2 AM were Korean basketball, Korean soccer, and tennis. 

I decided to pick all the tennis matches with the best odds to win, which ended up being 16 matches on a ten cent bet to win $9.00. I didn't think much of it and fell asleep that night, only to wake up in the morning with $9 in my Fanduel account - how splendid! It developed a new routine for me - play my Fanduel Faceoff bonus games to win anywhere from $0.09 to $1.00, play if I have the money in my account balance and if not, place some tennis parlays. I have been moderately successful actually, and I am currently waiting on a rain delayed match to finish and I will rake in $47.00 and $46.51 parlays that each had 12 and 14 matches with only $1 wagered on each. Pretty cool right?

Well, how does winning money on tennis matches make me fall in love with the sport? Well money makes it easy, but I like making informed decisions rather than throwing my money into a black hole so I began researching and learning more and that's where it all begins... 

## Internet Research and Becoming Jannik Sinner fan

So I learned a lot from the tennis ATP website, but I also found my favorite tennis player to be the number one player in the world. I came to this conclusion after he won me $50 one night (I really needed it) on a $1 bet. But I also found his journey to tennis stardom interesting and I liked his style of play. active

Jannik started out skiing at 3 years old, which I can dig because I'm a huge ski guy. He started tennis somewhat late for the usual tennis pro and never won an event as an amatuer, but quickly won when he got to the pros. He changed his serve a year or two ago and quickly ascended to first place. He seems like a chill dude and I love watching how fast he can move and his gnarly forehand shot is awesome. Watching him and Carlos Alcarez go at it for the Rolland Garos final was the match that really solidified my love or the sport. The five hour match was a heart breaker for Sinner, but it made me fall absolutely in love with watching tennis.

## What is Next?

Well I suppose the next most reasonable thing for me to do is go get a tennis racket and start praticing to go pro. JUST KIDDING - but I would love to start playing tennis. I have played a couple times before with an old girlfriend a long time ago and with a friend in college. It was really fun and I couldn't get either of them to keep playing as long as I wanted to play. 

So I think getting rackets and playing with Lisa until she hates tennis and playing competitive sports with me is definitely the next step. Then I will have to find some tennis playing friends who can kick my ass and humble me into learning how to properly hold a racket, serve, and return balls. After I am humiliated enough into lessons with a tennis coach or something when I have enough money to someday, I may be confident enough to step back on the court with somebody who plays regularly. If I am lucky, I will steal a game or two and possibly a match before I decide to enter a competition someday.

I hope thats how it goes. We'll see.... more to come for this story...
