## Abstract/Overview

*Stop marketing AT people! Turn your ideas into epidemics by helping your customers do the marketing for you.*

Directly from the back of the book:

> *Counter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to-customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread.*
> *In lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a "recipe" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smotth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any businesse, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn't want to hear it anymore form the traditional marketers.*
