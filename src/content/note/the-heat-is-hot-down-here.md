Today is the third or fourth day in the row (too hot to remember) of walking down the highway with the love of my life, screaming at each other about essentially nothing. Why? Because it is mother fucking hot outside is why.

## North Carolina Heat = Southern Fried Me

This is my sixth summer here in North Carolina I believe? Yet, it feels hotter than any other one that I can remember. Thanks to a tremendous amount of rain we've received so far, it feels like being placed in a wood stove pizza oven, inside of a sauna, inside of human crematorioum. I sometimes wonder if I am just going to evaporate one day, like spillling a shot glass full of water on black asphalt. That would almost be a kinder fate then having to endure this kind of heat while living outside as somebody without their basic needs met.
