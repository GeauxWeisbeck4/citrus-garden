## Introduction to Supporting Andrew

Welcome to the Support Me Posts and Updates section of my digital garden! This section shares updates from myself on projects I am working on, content I have created, products I have released, or anything else related to the topic of purchasing stuff, supporting me, or learning about how I use your kind help.

I am going to try and make an update at least once a month, but maybe even twice a month or weekly depending on how things go. My updates will include recent work that I've been able to produce thanks to the support I receive like blog posts, newsletters, coding projects, business ideas, merchandise, digital products etc. I will also share the people who contribute, where you can find more info about supporting me, and how much I have made since the last post and all time.

I have decided to really put my time into creating content, open source software, and selling stuff digitally for a number of reasons, but one big reason is that I have the time to do it and not many bills to pay right now because I'm currently living off the grid. While it is nice to have freedom, making money has been an absolute struggle for quite a while for me now. Working at Walmart didn't work and it is hard to find developer work with my current circumstances (but I'm still trying hard!). Supporting my work helps me survive and put myself into a better position so I can focus more on finding a good job as a full-stack software developer.

You have ended up here while either deciding if helping me is a good idea or after you have supported me in any way on any of the creator platforms and various channels I share content, products, and code through. I'll address both of y'all, but of course I must address my supporters first because they absolutely rock and mean so much to me! You do to if you are considering helping me but I have to prioritize the people who helped me eat today and helped me get one step closer to making my living situation better - being on this list is a great reason to support my work!

### Thank You For Your Help

If you have been directed here after supporting me on one of my creator channels, I just want to thank you for your kind support - you have no idea how grateful I am and how important every cent, kind word, and every kind of help is to me. I've been in quite a difficult financial situation for a while now and your help allows me to achieve my dreams and to be a more productive person who can contribute my skills to making the world a better place.

These last two years have been an incredible struggle, but they have been incredible for helping me grow as a human. Deciding to go all in on creating open source software, content, and pursuing ideas that I felt should be pursued was definitely scary for me. It is especially scary when you barely are able to eat each day. You have all made this less scary each time you have decided to help me out. Every time you help me is like taking a five pound weight off my shoulders because it means I get to keep creating for y'all and developing open source software instead of working at Walmart or panhandling, which are the main ways I've had to survive before this.

Your contributions go back into my work, into helping Lisa and I survive, and allow us to start saving to improve our current situation. Feel free to review all my updates and links to my various platforms - if there is anything you should have access to and don't, [please do not hesitate to contact me](/support). 

Again, thank you all! I love each one of you so much for your kindness and support!

### Potential Supporters

See how much I love them? Don't you want to be loved by somebody who is super awesome like that? I mean, it is ok if you are having trouble admitting it right now, but I understand that it is intimidating to be loved by somebody so cool and smart. That's ok though, because you can see all the awesome stuff you will also have access to if that is a little too overwhelming for you right now.

The Supporting Andrew Updates should contain almost everything that I have created, which includes open source software projects, content, merchandise, digital products, etc. If there is anything that you have a question about, don't hesitate to ask about it. Not everything will appeal to everyone, but I'm sure everyone can find something that will appeal to them here - if not I will make something that appeals to you, just let me know.

For example, you may wonder "What the hell would I do with an Astro.js Template? I don't build websites, I watch/hire you for that!" Fair enough, you may like my newsletters, blogs, or one of my cool software projects. Use social media but don't understand the Fediverse? Check out my Fediverse Zine (coming soon) to learn about how awesome decentralized social media is, why you need to use it right now (like seriously, that is for real), and how to get started with some of the most popular services. 

If there isn't anything that floats your boat, just hit me up and I'll work on your idea if it is feasible and something that could help others. Oh yeah, if you have something you want me to build for your business or something to sell, you're probably going to have to hire me, which is totally ok and cool with me - I love working! I'd just direct you to my digital services company for that though - [Tar Heel Dev Studio](https://tarheeldevstudio.com) or just contact me with any questions!

I'll wrap up this intro page with a list of the platforms you can support me on and all the ways you can support me as well as resources to things I create. Thank you for checking me out!
